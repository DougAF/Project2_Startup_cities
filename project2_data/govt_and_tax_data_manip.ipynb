    "The Kauffman Foundation’s Index of Entrepreneurial Activity shows that entrepreneurship can be a safe harbor for cities during difficult economic periods – as individuals lose their jobs during economic downturns, entrepreneurship tends to rise as they turn towards self-employment to keep their skills up or help pay the bills, and it declines again as the labor market recovers. This suggests that cities that create the right environment for entrepreneurs will be better positioned to weather challenging economic periods. Listening directly to entrepreneurs as the Thumbtack survey does can help cities understand which policies are making them small business friendly and which are keeping small business at bay."
